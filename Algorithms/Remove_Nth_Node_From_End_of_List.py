Value-Shifting

It may looks cheating but here we go.
Instead of really removing the nth node, remove the nth value. Recursively determine the indexes (counting from back), 
then shift the values for all indexes larger than n, and then always drop the head.

Index and Remove

Recursively determine the indexes again, 
but this time helper function removes the nth node. 
It returns two values. The index, as in first solution, and the possibly changed head of the remaining list.

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        def remove(head):
            if not head:
                return 0, head
            i, head.next = remove(head.next)
            return i+1, (head, head.next)[i+1 == n]
        return remove(head)[1]

n ahead


The standard solution, but without a dummy extra node. 
Instead, I simply handle the special case of removing the head right after the fast cursor got its head start.

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        fast = slow = head
        for _ in range(n):
            fast = fast.next
        if not fast:
            return head.next
        while fast.next:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head
